        `Diarrhea is loose, watery stools three or more times a day. It can lead to low, moderate or very high dehydration which is the depletion of sufficient fluids in the body. In addition, a person may lose electrolytes, sodium chloride,potassium or bicarbonate which are needed by the body to properly function. This may be life threatening, so keep hydrated to replenish the lost fluids. Malabsorption may also be caused by diarrhoea. Insufficient absorption of nutrients from food into the body may result in malnutrition. Diarrhoea is associated with a number of other problems.
