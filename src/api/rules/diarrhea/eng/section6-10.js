        Avoiding certain foods when having diarrhea is important because some foods can irritate the digestive system and worsen symptoms. Spicy, greasy, or fatty foods can be difficult for the body to digest, while foods containing lactose or fructose can exacerbate diarrhea in people with lactose or fructose intolerance. Furthermore, certain types of fiber, such as those found in beans, cruciferous vegetables, and whole grains, can  be difficult to digest and may cause gas or bloating. 
        
        Some of the foods you should avoid includes avoid Alchohol, beans, berries, brocoli, cabbage, cauliflower, cheese, chickpeas, coffee, corn,  dates, fruit jucies, grapes, green leafy  vegetables, gum, honey ice cream, milk,  nuts, oily foods, spicy foods, peppers,  raw meat , salads, shellfish, soft drinks,  and tea.

        So, it is best to stick with easily digestible, bland foods and avoid foods that may worsen diarrhea symptoms.
