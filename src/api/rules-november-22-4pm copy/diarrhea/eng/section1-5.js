    //     A weakened immune system is less effective at defending the body against harmful pathogens. These infections can cause inflammation and irritation in the intestines, resulting in diarrhea.

    //     Diarrhea is often a way for the body to remove harmful bacteria and toxins from the intestines. A compromised immune system cant prevent the body from responding effectively to these invaders, resulting in persistent diarrhea. Additionally, a weakened immune system can disrupt the balance between good and bad bacteria in the gut, allowing harmful bacteria to overgrow and cause diarrhea. Overall, a weak immune system makes you more susceptible to gastrointestinal infections that can cause diarrhea. It is important to take the following steps to boost your immune system: For example, a healthy diet, plenty of rest, and good hygiene can help reduce the risk of these infections and prevent diarrhea.

        Sweets could trigger diarrhea due to their ability to create an osmotic effect in the intestines, drawing water from the body into the digestive tract, and also due to their ability to stimulate the production of digestive enzymes and increase gut motility, leading to incomplete absorption of nutrients and water. Also , sometimes sweets are not well absorbed by the body and can ferment in the gut, causing gas, bloating and diarrhea in susceptible individuals. For example, lactose-intolerant people lack the enzyme lactase, which is necessary to break down the lactose in milk and dairy products. If lactose is not broken down properly, it can cause diarrhea.

        Staying hydrated is important because diarrhea can lead to significant fluid loss. Diarrhea causes the body to lose water and electrolytes, such as sodium and potassium, which are essential for normal bodily functions.
        
        Drinking fluids, such as  water, buko juice, am, arrozcaldo, soups, sports drinks, broths, and oral rehydration solutions, can replace lost fluids and electrolytes and prevent dehydration. It is also recommended to avoid beverages that can further irritate the stomach, such as alcohol, caffeine, and sugary drinks. 
       
        Proper hydration during diarrhea can help relieve symptoms and prevent complications  that can arise from dehydration.

Moreover, to prevent the risk of further infections, zinc supplements can also help restore healthy intestinal flora. However, because excessive zinc intake can be detrimental, it is advisable that all supplements should be discussed with a healthcare professional prior to use.
